### Hey there ðŸŒ»

I'm a Software Developer who tries to make everything from games, engines, tool & web.
<br>
I like building reliable & lightweight applications like it's the 90s.

Above all, I have a strong passion for learning, and I'm always looking to deepen my understanding.

I mostly code in either C or C++ but I frequently use Lua & Python as well.

I'm currently working on a lightweight library for game development in C, and a commercial game I plan on releasing.
